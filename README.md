swift-toolchain-sqlite
======================

The [SQLite Amalgamation](https://sqlite.org/amalgamation.html) from sqlite.org as a Swift package.

This is intended as a common infrastructure package for components of the Swift toolchain which depend on SQLite.
It is not intended as a general-purpose SQLite package, nor does it aim to provide Swift wrapper APIs.

This package has been tested on macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS, Mac Catalyst, Linux, Windows, and WebAssembly.
